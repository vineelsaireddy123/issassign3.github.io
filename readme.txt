The portfolio and text analyzer code assumes that users will have JavaScript enabled on their devices for full functionality, with placeholder images eventually replaced by actual photos of S. Vineel Sai Reddy and Kadapa scenes. The "Download CV" button currently lacks an actual file attachment, awaiting implementation of a real PDF file. The text analyzer functionality is designed specifically for English language text, recommending at least 10,000 words for meaningful analysis but capable of processing any text length. The responsive design accommodates various screen sizes, while user interaction tracking is currently limited to console logging rather than server-side storage. The provided LinkedIn and GitHub profile URLs, along with the email address and phone number, are presumed accurate and intended for public display. The navigation system assumes users will intuitively understand how to interact with the dropdown menu to access different sections of the combined portfolio and analyzer page.
